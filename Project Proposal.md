## Project Name: TextVision

### Introduction

**TextVision** is an advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) application developed in Java. The primary goal of TextVision is to convert text embedded in images or scanned documents into editable digital formats such as .txt files. By automatically detecting and extracting characters from photos or document images, the application eliminates the need for manual typing, thus saving significant time, effort, and resources.

The application is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and accessible to everyoneâ€”from students and professionals to organizations that regularly work with large volumes of text-based documents. Whether it is converting printed study materials, invoices, reports, or archival data, TextVision ensures fast and reliable text extraction with high accuracy.

### Motivation

In this fast-paced world we do not have enough time to waste in doing unnecessary and repetitive work. Manually typing text from documents and photos takes a lot of time and adds human error. An automated software can fix the problem. An OCR software is its best solution. To implement the concept of OCR I choose this project. I believe that the software will be helpful to many.

### Objectives

The main objectives of the **TextVision** application are:

- **Automated Text Extraction** - To develop a system capable of automatically detecting and extracting text from images, scanned documents, or photos with high accuracy.

- **Editable Format Conversion** - To provide users with the ability to save the extracted text in standard formats (e.g., .txt), making the content easy to edit, copy, and share.

- **Time and Effort Reduction** - To minimize manual typing and data entry, thereby saving time and reducing human errors.

- **User-Friendly Interface** - To design a simple, interactive, and accessible application that can be used by people with minimal technical knowledge.

- **Wide Applicability** - To create a versatile solution that can be used by students, researchers, office workers, and organizations for digitizing documents and making text more manageable.

- **Improved Productivity** - To enhance efficiency in both personal and professional workflows by enabling quick conversion of printed or handwritten documents into digital formats.

### Expected Outcome

- Images and scanned documents will be converted into machine-readable and editable text with a high level of accuracy.
- Users will be able to export the recognized text into formats such as .txt for further editing, storage, or sharing.
- A simple and intuitive interface will ensure that both technical and non-technical users can easily operate the application.
